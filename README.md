# Furigana

A Minecraft resource pack that provides Japanese [furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) for use with the
[Rubi mod](https://github.com/keve1227/rubi). The mod is not required to use this resource pack, but it is highly
recommended.

While the resource pack is fairly comprehensive, please note that I haven't thoroughly verified every annotation (there
are a lot of them), so I should expect there to be some inaccuracies. If you find any, please let me know by opening an
issue or submitting a pull request.

## Installation

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/keve1227/furigana/releases) and download the latest release.
2. Place the ZIP file in your Minecraft resource pack folder. You can find this folder by opening Minecraft and going to
   Options > Resource Packs > Open Pack Folder.

## Usage

The resource pack adds a "new" language that is separate from the standard Japanese translation. To enable it, go to
Options > Language and select "日本語＋振り仮名 (日本)" from the list.
